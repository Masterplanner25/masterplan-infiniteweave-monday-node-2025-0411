# 🧠 A.I.N.D.Y. v0.9 — Research Engine Integration Build  
**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Branch:** `main` (merged from `feature/research-engine`)  
**Status:** ✅ Pre-Release | System Integration Complete  

---

## 🔧 Summary  
This update marks the official merge of the **Research Engine** and **Memory Bridge v0.1** into the main A.I.N.D.Y. architecture.  
It transforms A.I.N.D.Y. from a modular backend into a unified **AI-Native orchestration layer** — bridging metrics, symbolic memory, and service logic.

---

## 🚀 New Modules & Integrations
- **`research_results_service.py`** — AI-native research module with symbolic logging to the Memory Bridge  
- **`bridge.py`** — upgraded to **Memory Bridge v0.1** (Solon Protocol logic, continuity anchoring)  
- **`freelance_service.py`**, **`leadgen_service.py`**, **`deepseek_arm_service.py`** — added as new autonomous functional agents  
- **`main.py`** — unified all routers, added caching, threading, and middleware  
- **`models.py`** — expanded SQLAlchemy schema to include performance metrics, business formulas, and research result tracking  

---

## 🧩 Structural Changes
- Reorganized **database layer** → `db/models/` with centralized Base imports  
- Removed deprecated Alembic files and legacy `services/*` and `models/*` structures  
- Introduced **modules/** directory for scalable extensions  
- Added **tests/** folder for integration and performance testing  
- Refined FastAPI startup events with threaded background tasks (`check_reminders`, `handle_recurrence`)  

---

## 🧬 Symbolic & Systemic Additions
- Embedded **Solon Continuity Layer** for symbolic recall  
- Introduced **MemoryTrace()** runtime linkage for insight propagation  
- Added tags and trace logic for recursive knowledge graph formation  
- Marked start of **Bridge-to-Rust integration** for performance persistence
